# barebones-webserver
A bare bones web server written in C++ (orignally written for windows)

Based on the [forked repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqEqjODUkWY&t=7s); however, this WebServer has been modified for running on Linux (ubuntu/pop-os) and uses [**poll()**](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html) instead of [**select()** ](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html).

### UPDATE 1.0 - Thu Dec 19, 2019
It's recommended to used it on Firefox (so far), because Chrome is continuing asking to the server even when user didnt ask for anything
